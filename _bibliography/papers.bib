  abstract  = "Election outcomes can be difficult to predict. A recent example
               is the 2016 US presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton
               lost five states that had been predicted to go for her, and with
               them the White House. Most election polls ask people about their
               own voting intentions: whether they will vote and, if so, for
               which candidate. We show that, compared with own-intention
               questions, social-circle questions that ask participants about
               the voting intentions of their social contacts improved
               predictions of voting in the 2016 US and 2017 French
               presidential elections. Responses to social-circle questions
               predicted election outcomes on national, state and individual
               levels, helped to explain last-minute changes in people's voting
               intentions and provided information about the dynamics of echo
               chambers among supporters of different candidates. Galesic et
               al. show that election poll questions that ask participants
               about the voting intentions of their social contacts, in
               addition to their own intentions, improve predictions of voting
               in the 2016 US and 2017 French presidential elections.",

  abstract  = "We convened a workshop to enable scientists who study water
               systems from both social science and physical science
               perspectives to develop a shared language. This shared language
               is necessary to bridge a divide between these disciplines'
               different conceptual frameworks. As a result of this workshop,
               we argue that we should view socio-hydrological systems as
               structurally co-constituted of social, engineered, and natural
               elements and study the ``characteristic management challenges''
               that emerge from this structure and reoccur across time, space,
               and socioeconomic contexts. This approach is in contrast to
               theories that view these systems as separately conceptualized
               natural and social domains connected by bi-directional
               feedbacks, as is prevalent in much of the water systems research
               arising from the physical sciences. A focus on emergent
               characteristic management challenges encourages us to go beyond
               searching for evidence of feedbacks and instead ask questions
               such as: What types of innovations have successfully been used
               to address these challenges? What structural components of the
               system affect its resilience to hydrological events and through
               what mechanisms? Are there differences between successful and
               unsuccessful strategies to solve one of the characteristic
               management challenges? If so, how are these differences affected
               by institutional structure and ecological and economic contexts?
               To answer these questions, social processes must now take center
               stage in the study and practice of water management. We also
               argue that water systems are an important class of coupled
               systems with relevance for sustainability science because they
               are particularly amenable to the kinds of systematic comparisons
               that allow knowledge to accumulate. Indeed, the characteristic
               management challenges we identify are few in number and recur
               over most of human history and in most geographical locations.
               This recurrence should allow us to accumulate knowledge to
               answer the above questions by studying the long historical
               record of institutional innovations to manage water systems.",

               This article presents a general dynamic model of renewable
               energy policy with long time horizons, endogenous electoral
               competition, and techno-political path dependence. We calibrate
               the model with data on the economics of contemporary renewable
               energy technologies. In doing so, we discover transition
               dynamics not present in economy-energy models, which ignore
               politics, or in formal political economy models, which ignore
               long-term technological dynamics. We show that the largest
               effects of partisan ideology on policy occur when the competing
               parties disagree on the importance of energy policy. In these
               cases, the less ideological party appeases the more ideological
               one, while the more ideological party attempts to appease the
               electorate. The results demonstrate that political dynamics
               could have large effects on the development of renewable energy
               and carbon dioxide emissions over time, influencing the ability

               public participation that allows citizens to influence the
               implementation of public laws in courts. How does this
               institution influence policymaking? This article proposes a
               model of citizen suits. It then analyzes how this institution
               influences legislative decisions. The legislature bargains to
               choose the budget, distributive spending, and spending on an
               ideologically contested public good (e.g., health care or
               environmental protection). I find that citizen suits enable
               courts to forge a compromise between opponents and proponents of
               the public good by responding to the diverse claims of citizens.
               Anticipating the mobilization of citizens in courts, legislators
               in turn craft more socially efficient bills, with less
               distributive spending, which better represent the distribution

  author    = "Dumas, Marion and Barker, Jessica L and Power, Eleanor A",
  abstract  = "Performing a dramatic act of religious devotion, creating an art
               exhibit, or releasing a new product are all examples of public
               acts that signal quality and contribute to building a
               reputation. Signalling theory predicts that these public
               displays can reliably reveal quality. However, data from
               ethnographic work in South India suggests that more prominent
               individuals gain more from reputation-building religious acts
               than more marginalized individuals. To understand this
               phenomenon, we extend signalling theory to include variation in
               people's social prominence or social capital, first with an
               analytical model and then with an agent-based model. We consider
               two ways in which social prominence/capital may alter
               signalling: (i) it impacts observers' priors, and (ii) it alters
               the signallers' pay-offs. These two mechanisms can result in
               both a 'reputational shield,' where low quality individuals are
               able to 'pass' as high quality thanks to their greater social
               prominence/capital, and a 'reputational poverty trap,' where
               high quality individuals are unable to improve their standing
               owing to a lack of social prominence/capital. These findings
               bridge the signalling theory tradition prominent in behavioural
               ecology, anthropology and economics with the work on status
               hierarchies in sociology, and shed light on the complex ways in
               which individuals make inferences about others. This article is

  abstract  = "To build better theories of cities, companies, and other social
               institutions such as universities, requires that we understand
               the tradeoffs and complementarities that exist between their
               core functions, and that we understand bounds to their growth.
               Scaling theory has been a powerful tool for addressing such
               questions in diverse physical, biological and urban systems,
               revealing systematic quantitative regularities between size and
               function. Here we apply scaling theory to the social sciences,
               taking a synoptic view of an entire class of institutions. The
               United States higher education system serves as an ideal case
               study, since it includes over 5,800 institutions with shared
               broad objectives, but ranges in strategy from vocational
               training to the production of novel research, contains public,
               nonprofit and for-profit models, and spans sizes from 10 to
               roughly 100,000 enrolled students. We show that, like organisms,
               ecosystems and cities, universities and colleges scale in a
               surprisingly systematic fashion following simple power-law
               behavior. Comparing seven commonly accepted sectors of higher
               education organizations, we find distinct regimes of scaling
               between a school's total enrollment and its expenditures,
               revenues, graduation rates and economic added value. Our results
               quantify how each sector leverages specific economies of scale
               to address distinct priorities. Taken together, the scaling of
               features within a sector along with the shifts in scaling across
               sectors implies that there are generic mechanisms and
               constraints shared by all sectors, which lead to tradeoffs
               between their different societal functions and roles. We
               highlight the strong complementarity between public and private
               research universities, and community and state colleges, that
               all display superlinear returns to scale. In contrast to the
               scaling of biological systems, our results highlight that much
               of the observed scaling behavior is modulated by the particular
               strategies of organizations rather than an immutable set of
               constraints.",

               requires changing products. The automotive industry, for
               example, needs to massively deploy alternative-fuel vehicles.
               Product manufacturing occurs within supply-chain networks, and

               regulators. Lastly, we compare the power of alternative models
