This project investigates under what conditions green products (e.g. highly energy efficient appliances, organic food, low-harm chemicals, electric vehicles...) become affordable to the mass consumer market.

Companies often invest in green products to differentiate themselves and offer a higher-quality product that can fetch a higher price. They use environmental quality to price discriminate. Hence, the products cater to richer (less price-sensitive) consumers. When can we expect that this will be followed by a "green product cycle" -- the process by which a product goes from a niche expensive good to an affordable mainstream good?

Theoretically, I study two levers. First, I investigate if the degree of inequality of consumers' spending power affects the green product cycle.
Second, I investigate how bans on low environmental quality goods affect affordability of high environmental quality goods.

Empirically, I use the Nielsen Homescan dataset to study the case of organic products in the US.  Preliminary results suggest that demand for green is increasing, which stimulates green innovation; but heterogeneity between consumers creates incentives for firms to segment the market, which limits the spontaneous mainstreaming of green products in the absence of regulation.
